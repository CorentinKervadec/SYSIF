# LM loading

Start with the Pythia suite

Load it into an abstract LM class.

Build upon hugging face. There is probably no need to an abstraction over hugging face.

The features I need:

+ forward pass
+ get output probability
+ get attention maps
+ get activation values
+ get intermediate representation
